Emotion Detector â€” NLP Project
This project is a text-based Emotion Detection system powered by Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. It uses the GoEmotions dataset by Google and a fine-tuned BERT model from Hugging Face to predict emotions from text input. Users can enter any sentence, and the model will classify it into one of 27 human emotions with high accuracy.

The project includes a sleek, interactive web interface built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and Flask, featuring:

->Dark/Light theme toggle
-> Emoji animation based on detected emotion
